# belly-button-challenge

I used the 14.3 class activity 10 as a reference point for working on the challenege and the below resources:
https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp

The Object.entries(): static method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property key-value pair. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries

forEach(): method calls a function for each element in an array: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_foreach.asp

The interactive dashboard is deployed to https://ygu889.github.io/belly-button-challenge/
